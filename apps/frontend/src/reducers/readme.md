### About

The reducers contained here will be used by React's proprietary useReducer() system, not by **Redux**.
These will serve as creators of **independent component state container** so there is no need to include and store them inside the Redux **global state container**.
For the **redux** global reducers please check the `/store/reducers` directory.
